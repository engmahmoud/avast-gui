avast-gui
=========

A Python/Qt user interface for the Avast virus scanner; partly because I just could not be asked to build a 32-bit version of the gtk-qt4 theme engine for the official Avast gui; partly because I need to get up to speed on my user-interface coding.

As of Tuesday 23rd of April, the bare ui is lacking any implementation.
